I look at you all
see the love
further sleeping
while my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor
and I see
it needs sweeping
still my guitar gently weeps
i dont know why
nobody told you
how to unfold your love
i dont know how
someone controlled you
they bought and sold you
I look at the world
and I notice its turning
while my guitar gently weeps
with every mistake we must show we will be learning
still my guitar gently weeps
eeeeee
i dont know how
you were diverted
you were perverted too
i dont know how
you were inverted
no one alerted you
my look at you all
see the love let that sleeping
my my guitar gently weeps
my love look at you all
still my guitar gently weeps
o o ooo ooo oo
