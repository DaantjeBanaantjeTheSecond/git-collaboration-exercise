 She's not a girl who misses much, dudududududu oh yeah
 She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand like a lizard on a window pane
 A man in the crowd with the multi-coloured mirrors on his heart-nail boots
 Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy working overtime
 A short impression by his wife which he had and donated to the national trust

 I need a fix cuz I'm gone down
 down to the bits that I left uptown
 I need a fix cuz I'm gone down

 Mother superior jumped the gun
 Mother superior jumped the gun
 Mother superior jumped the gun
 Mother superior jumped the gun
 Mother superior jumped the gun
 Mother superior jumped the gun

 Happiness is a warm gun (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
 Happiness is a warm gun, mama (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
 When I hold you in my arms (oh yeah)
 And I feel my finger on your trigger (oh yeah)
 I know nobody can do me no harm because (oh yeah)
 Happiness is a warm gun, mama (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
 Happiness is a warm gun, yes it is (bang, bang, shoot, shoot)
 Happiness is a warm, yes it is, gun
 (Happiness, bang, bang, shoot, shoot) But don't you know that happiness (happiness, bang, bang, shoot,shoot) is a warm gun, mama
 (yeahhh)
