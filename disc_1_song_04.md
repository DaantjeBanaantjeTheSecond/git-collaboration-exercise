Desmond has the barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to molly girl i like your face
and molly says is that you (not understandable)

ob-la-di, ob-la-da
life goes on right
lalalala life goes on
ob-la-di, ob-la-da
life goes on right
lalalala life goes on

Desmond takes a dolly to the jewelery store
buys a 20 karat golden ring
takes it back to molly waiting at the door
and as he gives it to her she begins to sing

ob-la-di, ob-la-da
life goes on right
lalalala life goes on
ob-la-di, ob-la-da
life goes on right
lalalala life goes on

in a couple of years they will have build a home
sweet home
with a couple of kids running at the yard
of desmond and molly jones
Happy ever after in the marketplace
desmond lets the children lend a hand
molly stays at home and does the pretty face
and in the evening she still  sings it with the band

ob-la-di, ob-la-da
life goes on right
lalalala life goes on
ob-la-di, ob-la-da
life goes on right
lalalala life goes on

in a couple of years they have built a home
sweet home
with a couple of kids running in the yard
of desmond and molly jones

they happy ever after in the marketplace
